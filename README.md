Tribes
--------------

A financial network of American Tribes using Bitcoin to cut out the Middle-men.

Each Tribe is legally a Corporation, but the group within it can be a small business, a church, a nuclear family, etc.

This allows Tribes to do business with one another under the protections of federal law, while granting privacy to its individuals and insulating them from some liabilities.
