### Abstract
- [Trust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trust_(social_science)) is a Soft Commodity
- [Incentivizing] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incentive) Trust increases Social Cohesion
- Social Cohesion, in 2020, can surely bring a [Renaissance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance)
- Renaissance, by 2030, is the Goal


### Criminals
- Successful Criminals often have more resources than average American business owner.    
- The solution is for business owners to cooperate against criminals in the courts of public opinion and U.S. Common Law.    
- Cooperation is accomplished through sharing data and pooling resources into an Insurance Contract.    
- An Insurance Contract is cheap and quick to create & agree to using Bitcoin + a Public Notary.    


### Liars
- Lying "Tears at the fabric of Reality". [Solzhenitsyn 1973, J.Peterson ~2017]    
- It is very bad for business, because it causes confusion and delusion.    

### American Business
- Any business colloquially referred to as a "small business" should benefit from this proposed solution (aka Tribes).    

### Bitcoin
- Bitcoin can not be confiscated or stolen without the exposure if its owner's Private Key.    
- Private Keys are long strings of random characters.    
- Its possible for business to operate in a manner in which the only serious threat to a Private Key theft is a very local threat.    
- If the threat of a small business to lose its funds is turned into a local-only threat, and the business has Common-Law Contracts with other small businesses, the incentives of the business have turned towards cooperation and good-standing with its fellow local-businesses, as well as towards secure-keeping of its most valuable Private Keys.

### Law
