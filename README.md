TRIBES
------------


## Kevin's August 23 Proposal

1. Build a physical network of Tribers members. I suggest we both formalize and combine our "Dunbar" lists [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar%29s_number]
2. Design devices ("Totems"?) that operate as a type of Notary for this network by generating, storing and transmitting Bitcoin Private Keys (using Ultra-Wideband?). (There may need to be a Transmitting Totem and a Receiving Totem, using Ultra-Wideband and LiDAR respectively)
3. Build a (Wrapped?) Bitcoin ERC-20 token that elaborate upon the Bitcoin transactions: https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Protocol_documentation)

## Kevin's August 23 Letter to Avis

Avis,
I appreciate and Trust you. Its interesting that the "Trust" portion allows you and I to conduct commerce quickly and confidently, with the least amount of Middle-Men possible. In other words, its an efficient relationship. 

I believe that we can build networks of Trusted relationships that allow commerce between individuals without the burdens of middle-men, intermediaries or riff-raff interlopers. I believe that the Bitcoin Lightning Network may already do this. I believe it could be formalized using ERC-20 contracts that are really just the details of either:

1. A consentual, legal and immutable contract between two parties 
   Or
2. An act of sabatoge or theft

(In other words, the ERC-20 contract is some more Evidence to allow a Legal interpretation of what occurred. The primary evidence of a Legal contract having occurred is a Bitcoin Transaction and the current owner of a licensed (a common-law notarization event?) Totem).

There are giants whose shoulders my thoughts are currently standing on. The most notable is Nick Szabo. Here are some examples:
