Tribes
----------------

Cutting out
   the
Criminals & Liars
   from
American Business
   using
Bitcoin &
Contract Law.


## Criminals
Successful Criminals often have more resources than average American business owner.
The solution is for business owners to cooperate against criminals in the courts of public opinion and U.S. Common Law.
Cooperation is accomplished through sharing data and pooling resources into an Insurance Contract.
An Insurance Contract is cheap and quick to create & agree to using Bitcoin + a Public Notary.

## Liars
Lying "Tears at the fabric of Reality". [Solzhenitsyn 1973, J.Peterson ~2017]
It is very bad for business, because it causes confusion and delusion.

## American Business
Any business colloquially referred to as a "small business" should benefit from this proposed solution (aka Tribes).

## Bitcoin
Bitcoin can not be confiscated or stolen without the exposure if its owner's Private Key.
Private Keys are long strings of random characters.
Its possible for business to operate in a manner in which the only serious threat to a Private Key theft is a very local threat.
If the threat of a small business to lose its funds is turned into a local-only threat, and the business has Common-Law Contracts with other small businesses, the incentives of the business have turned towards cooperation and good-standing with its fellow local-businesses, as well as towards secure-keeping of its most valuable Private Keys.

## Contract Law

## DRAFT: description statements
A financial network of American Tribes using Bitcoin to cut out the Middle-men.

Each Tribe is legally a Corporation, but the group within it can be a small business, a church, a nuclear family, etc.

This allows Tribes to do business with one another under the protections of federal law, while granting privacy to its individuals and insulating them from some liabilities.
